# Mobile Polish Notes

1. **Hero headline + pricing chip**  
   The jumbo hero text and floating rate card looked oversized and covered important content on phones. I scaled the typography down, added tighter padding, hid the floating desktop card on small screens, and added a tidy mobile-friendly "Projects from R600" chip under the intro copy so the call-to-action shows without overlap.

2. **Services block spacing**  
   The dark services grid had huge top/bottom padding and the bullet lists were indented too far, forcing users to scroll sideways mentally. I switched the section to mobile-first spacing, lowered the heading size for small screens, and pulled the bullet points closer so everything fits neatly without weird gaps.

3. **Projects carousel**  
   The mobile carousel previously used desktop spacing, so cards felt cramped and the navigation controls were hard to target. I reduced the vertical padding, let the headline scale down, gave the cards taller imagery + larger text, moved the thumbnail tray and helper text under the card, and let the arrow/dot controls wrap so they don’t squish together on narrow phones.

4. **Process timeline**  
   Each process step forced a full screen height even on phones, which made scrolling feel laggy. I lowered the min-height, added smaller typography, and trimmed the gutters so images and copy sit closer together. This keeps the scroll smooth while still keeping the alternating layout on larger screens.

Let me know if you spot any other rough edges on smaller devices and we can keep tightening things up.
